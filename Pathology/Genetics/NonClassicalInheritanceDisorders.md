# Non Classical Inheritance Disorders
## Genomic Imprinting
- Differential gene expression based on parent of origin
- Epigenetic regulation  $\rightarrow$ Gene silencing
	- DNA methylation
	- Histone deacylation
	- Histone methylation
- Can be checked by
	- Methylation status of marker gene
	- FISH
- Imprinting is related to
	- Prader Willi Syndrome
	- Angelman Syndrome
	- McCune Albright Dystrophy
	- Beckwith-Weidman Syndrome
	- Huntington's Disease
	- Myotonic Dystrophy
	- Tumorigenesis

### Prader Willi Syndrome
#### Etiology
- Deletion of paternal chromosome (MC)
- Uniparental Disomy (Maternal chromosome)
- $\downarrow$ $\downarrow$ SNORP (Small nucleolar RNA proteins)
#### Clinical Features
- Mental Retardation
- Obesity
- Hypotonia
- Hypogonadism

### Angelman Syndrome
#### Etiology
- Deletion of maternal chromosome
- Uniparental disomy
- Gene involved  $\rightarrow$ UBEZA
#### Clinical Features
- **S**eizures
- **A**taxia
- **R**etardation
- **I**nappropriate laughter

## Mitochondrial inheritance
![MitochondrialInheritancePedigree](Pathology/Images/MitochondrialInheritancePedigree.jpg)
- Maternal inheritance
- mtDNA is present in ovum and not sperm
- Heteroplasmy  $\rightarrow$ Normal and defective mtDNA in a single cell
- Involvement of
	- Cardiac muscle
	- Skeletal Muscle
	- Kidney
	- CNS
	- Liver
- Examples
	- MELAS  $\rightarrow$ Mitochondrial Encephelopathy with Lactic acidosis and Stroke like episodes
	- Leigh's Disease
	- NARP Syndrome  $\rightarrow$ Neuropathy, Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa
	- Leber's Optic Neuropathy

## Germline Mosaicism
- AD
- 1 affected parent  $\rightarrow$ Normal
- No affected parent (Rare)
	- Person(Normal)  $\rightarrow$ Post zygotic mutation affecting gonadal cells  $\rightarrow$ Progeny affected
- Examples
	- Osteogenesis imperfecta
	- Tuberous sclerosis

## Tiple Repeat Mutations
### General
- **Presence of Long nucleotide repeats**
- Seen in neurodegenerative diseases
- Dynamic in Nature
- Amplification of nucleotide repeats at the time of gametogenesis for the next generation
- Next generation have disease presentation earlier **Anticipation**
- Coding regions affected
	- Huntington's  $\rightarrow$ CAG repeats
	- Kennedy's disease  $\rightarrow$ CAG repeats
	- SCA 1,2,3,6,7  $\rightarrow$ CAG repeats
	- Haw River Syndrome  $\rightarrow$ CAG repeats
	- Machado Josesh disease  $\rightarrow$ SCA 3
	- SCA 6  $\rightarrow$ Voltage gated calcium channel is affected
- Non coding regions affected in
	- Fragile X Syndrme  $\rightarrow$ CGG repeats
	- Myotonic dystrophy  $\rightarrow$ CTG repeats
	- Friedrich's ataxia  $\rightarrow$ GAA repeats
### Fragile X Syndrome
- Problem at Xq
- **FMR-1 gene** _loss of function_ mutation
- 2<sup>nd</sup> MC cause of Mental retardation
- Manifestations (X Large)
	- Large Facies
	- Large mandible
	- Large testicular tissue
	- Large everted ears
- Other manifestations
	- High arhed palate
	- MVP
	- Hyper-extensible joints
### Sherman's Paradox
- Chances of developing Mental Retardation is more in grandson by Anticipation
- Nucleotide repeats  $\rightarrow$ Pre mutation  $\rightarrow$ Mutation
