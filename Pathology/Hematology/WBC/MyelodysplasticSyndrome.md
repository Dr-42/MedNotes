# Myelodysplastic Syndrome

## General
- Maturation defect at the level of myeloid cells leading to dyserythropoesis
- Dyserythropoesis leading to hypercellular BM and pancytopenia blood picture
- $\uparrow$ risk of [AML](Pathology/Hematology/WBC/AML.md)

## Subtypes
- 1<sup>o</sup> MDS
	- Elderly (Mean age  $\rightarrow$ 70yrs)
	- Idiopathic
- 2<sup>o</sup> MDS  $\rightarrow$ Known cause
	- Also referred as **Treatment associated MDS** (t-MDS)
	- H/O exposure to anticancer drugs/radiation  $\rightarrow$ 2-8yrs  $\rightarrow$ MDS
	- Genetic defects
		- Epigenetic modification
			- DNA methylation
			- Histone modification
			- Chromatin looping
		- Nuclear transcription factors
		- Trouble in RNA splicing

## Cytogenetic abnormalities
- Chromosome 5q deletion  $\rightarrow$ Seen in adults (MC overall)
- Monosomy 7  $\rightarrow$ seen in children
- P53 gene
- Trisomy 8 (MYC)
> MC cytogenic abnormality in **India**  $\rightarrow$ Complex karyotype
> MC cytogenetic abnormality in **Western countries**  $\rightarrow$ 5q deletion
### CHIP (Clonal Hematopoesis of Indeterminate Potential)
- Mutation at the primitive levels of the cells
- Pro-inflammatory state
- Associated with MDS and Atherosclerosis

## Diagnosis
- BM exam
	- Hypercellularity
	- Megaloblastic RBCs
	- Nuclear budding anomaly
		![NucleatedRBCwithBuds](Pathology/Images/NucleatedRBCwithBuds.jpg)
	- Ringed Sideroblasts
	- **Pseudo pelger huet** cells  $\rightarrow$ Seen in MDS/[AML](Pathology/Hematology/WBC/AML.md)/[CML](Pathology/Hematology/WBC/CML.md)
		![PseudoPelgerHuetCells](Pathology/Images/PseudoPelgerHuetCells.jpg)
	- **Pawn ball megakaryocytes**
		![PawnBallMegakaryocytes](Pathology/Images/PawnBallMegakaryocytes.jpg)
- Peripheral smear
	- Pancytopenia
	- Abnormal cells

## Clinical Features
- Elderly with fatigue
- Petechiae  $\rightarrow$ Bleeding tendency  $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ Platelets
- Fever  $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ WBC
- Anemia  $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ RBC

## Treatment
- Allogenic BM transplant  $\rightarrow$ Young patients
- Azacitidine/Decitabine  $\rightarrow$ DNA methylation inhibitors
- Lenalidomide  $\rightarrow$ For 5q deletion
- Antibiotics
- Repeated blood transfusions
