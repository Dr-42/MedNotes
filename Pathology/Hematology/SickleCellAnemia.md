# Sickle Cell Anemia

## General
- It is a _qualitative disorder of hemoglobin_

## Pathophysiology
- Point mutation at HBB gene (Hemoglobin beta gene) at Chr11p15.5 from **GAG** to **GTG**
- This substitution of **Glutamic acid** to **Valine** at the **6<sup>th</sup> position** in the $\beta$-chain of Hb

## Genetics

## Clinical Features
- Geographically more common in Africans
- Anemia/retarded growth
- Abdominal discomfort  $\rightarrow$ Splenomegaly (in later stages)

## Complications
- MC complication  $\rightarrow$ Vaso-occlusive crisis
	- Ischemia in differnt organs of the body
		- Bones
			- Small bones of Hand and Feet  $\rightarrow$ **Hand and Foot Syndrome / Dactylitis**
			- Long bones  $\rightarrow$ **Avascular necrosis** of neck of femur
			- Skull  $\rightarrow$ Crew cut appearance
			- Vertebral column
				- Backache
				- H-shaped vertebrae / Cod fish Vertebrae / Fish Mouth vertebrae
		- CNS 
			- TIA
			- Stroke
		- Skin
			- Chronic non-healing leg ulcers (In medial malleolus)
		- Spleen
			- Early
				- $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ Size
				- Occlusion of veins
				- Congestive splenomegaly  $\rightarrow$ **Gandy gamma body Ca<sup>2+</sup> deposition + Fibrosis**
			- Later
				- Arterial occlusion
				- Ischemic damage
				- Fibrosis
				- Autosplenectomy
		- Penis
			- Painful undesirable erection  $\rightarrow$ Priapism
		- Pulmonary circulation  $\rightarrow$ **Acute chest syndrome**
			- Pain in chest
			- Dyspnea
			- $\downarrow$ O<sub>2</sub> in blood
- Aplastic Crisis
	- BM hyperactivated due to compensation
	- $\uparrow$ chance of _Parvovirus infection_
- Sequesteration crisis
	- $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ Splenic size due to $\uparrow$ blood in Spleen
	- Hypovolemia
- Patient becomes symptomatic when there is
	- Infection
	- Dehydration
	- Hypoxemia (any kind)

## Diagnosis
- Blood
	- $\downarrow$ Hb
	- $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ TLC
	- $\downarrow$ $\downarrow$ $\downarrow$ ESR
	- Peripheral Smear Shows
		- Sickle Cells (Drepanocytes)
		- Normal RBCs
		- HJ Bodies
		- Target Cells

- Dithionite/Metabisulphite Test
	- To check if RBCs sickle by creating artificial hypoxia
- Osmotic Fragility Test
	- SCA  $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ Osmotic Fragility
> Decreased Osmotic fragility is seen in all Hemoglobinopathies  $\rightarrow$ Thalassemia (both $\beta$ and $\alpha$) and in IDA too

- Hb Electrophoresis
	- Glutamic acid is polar while Valine is Neutral hence no movement towards anode
	![SickleCellElectrophoresis](Pathology/Images/SickleCellElectrophoresis.jpg)
	- Limitations  $\rightarrow$ requires expertise
- **Genetic Analysis (IOC)**
- **HPLC**
	- Can differentiate the types of Hb
	- Quantity of HbS can be known
	- _IOC_ if genetic analysis is not available

## Treatment
- Routinely SCA pateints present with stunted growth
- If other complications are present  $\rightarrow$ Symptomatic treatment
