# Aplastic Anemia
## General
- Associated with hematopoetic stem cell defect  $\rightarrow$ Pancytopenia
- Associated with
	- Drugs
	- Antithymocyte Globulin (ATG)
	- Cyclosporin
	- [PNH](Pathology/Hematology/RBC/PNH.md)  $\rightarrow$ d/t **T cell activity against GPI - linked protein**
- AA can progress to
	- Myelodysplastic Syndrome
	- [AML](Pathology/Hematology/WBC/AML.md)
## Causes
- Inherited
	- Telomerase defect
	- Fanconi Anemia
		- [Autosomal Recessive](Pathology/Genetics/SingleGeneDisorders.md#Autosomal%20Recessive%20Disorders) inheritance
		- Defect in DNA repair genes
		- Hypoplasia
			- Kidney
			- Spleen
		- Bone defects
			- Radius
			- Thumb
> Fanconi Syndrome is associated with Renal Tubular Damage  $\rightarrow$ **Different from Fanconi Anemia**
- Acquired
	- Immune mediated
	- Idiopathic (MC)
- Chemicals
	- Dose related
		- Alkylating agents
		- Antimetabolites
		- Chloramphenicol
	- Dose unrelated  $\rightarrow$ Even single dose can cause
		- Gold Salts
		- Chloramphenicol
- Physical
	- Radiation
	- Viruses
		- EBV
		- VZV
		- CMV

## Clinical Features
- No age prediliction
- No sex prediliction
- Features of pancytopenia
	- Fatigue
	- Fever
	- Hemorrhage (Bleeding manifestations)
- <b>Splenomegaly is <u>never seen</u></b>

## Diagnosis
- Blood
	- Pancytopenia
	- Reticulocytopenia
	- Macrocytic normochromic RBCs
- BM aspiration
	- Dry tap
- BM biopsy
	- $\downarrow$ Cellularity
> Aplastic Anemia BM biopsy is different from MDS and Acute Leukemia as they are hypercellular Hypercellular

## Treatment
- TOC  $\rightarrow$ Bone marrow Transplant
- Drugs  $\rightarrow$ Antithymocyte globulin
- Cyclosporin

## Classification
- Non-severe/Moderate AA
	- BM cellularity > 25%
- Severe AA
	- Features
		- Absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm<sup>3</sup> 
		- Platelet count < 20,000/mm<sup>3</sup> 
		- Reticulocyte count < 60,000/mm<sup>3</sup> 
	- Any **2 of 3 features** present + **BM cellularity < 25%**
- Very severe
	- Severe AA + Absolute neutrophil count < 200/mm<sup>3</sup> 
> Common cause of death in Severe AA is **Septicemia**
