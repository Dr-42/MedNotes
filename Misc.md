# Basic Anatomy of GIT
- There are four layers (inner to outer)
	1. Mucosa 
		1. Epithelium
		2. Lamina Propria
		3. Muscularis Mucosa
	2. Submucosa
	3. Muscularis propria
		1. Inner Longitudinal
		2. Outer Circular
	4. Serosa
- There are two kinds of plexus in GIT
	- Auerbach plexus
		- Peristaltic function
		- Located between inner circular and outer longitudinal
	- Meissner's plexus
		- Vilious motility and intestinal secretion
		- Location between inner circular layer and muscularis mucosa
> In esophagus there is no serosa, no villi no secretions no **Meissner's plexus**
> Esophagus has hymphatics in Lamina propria (No other part of GIT has that) 
> Strongest layer of GIT - Submucosa
> Catgut is prepared from sheep ileum submucosa
> Gall bladder is missing muscularis mucosa and submucosa
> Maximum absorptive capacity - jejunum
> Maximum absorptive capacity per unit surface area - gall bladder

# MRCP
- T2 phase of MRI
	- Fast moving fluid
		- Gives no signal
		- Black
	- Slow moving fluids like _bile, pancreati juice_
		- High signal intensity
		- Appears white (no contrast needed)
- IOC for
	- CBD stone
	- Choledochal cyst
	- Biliary stricture
	- Cholangiosarcoma
		- MRI + MRCP is IOC
	- Primary sclerosing cholangitis
	- Pancreatic divisum
	- Chronic Pancreatitis
