## Oral Hypoglycemics

### Insulin secretagogoues
#### General
- > 30% functional $\beta$ cells should be present
- S/E of hypoglycemia
- TO REMEMBER  $\rightarrow$ **Drugs ending in -ide** cause hypoglycemia
#### Sulphonyureas
- 1<sup>st</sup> generation
	- Chlorpropamide
	- Tolbutamide
- 2<sup>nd</sup> generation
	- Glipizide
	- Gliclazide
	- Glibenclamide
#### Meglitinides
- Nataglinide
- Repaglinide

### Drugs mimicing isulin
#### Biguanides (AMP Kinases)
- Drugs
	- Metformin
	- Phenformin
- Act by activating AMP Kinase
- Effects
	- Gluconeogenesis -ve
	- Glycogenolysis -ve
	- Glycogenesis +ve
	- Glycolysis +ve
- S/E
	- Megaloblastic Anaemia  $\rightarrow$ more with <u>Metformin</u>
	- Lactic acidosis  $\rightarrow$ more with <u>Phenformin</u>
	- *Phenformin* not used now
		- Contraindicated in
			- Liver disease
			- Renal disease
			- Lung disease
	- *Metformin*  $\rightarrow$ DOC in Type 2 DM
		- No risk of Hypoglycemia
		- Max reduction in HbA1c
		- Can cause weight loss (no weight gain)
		- Also indicated in *PCOD*  $\rightarrow$ reverse insulin resistance
> Metformin preferred in <u>Obese</u> patients
> Sulphonylureas preferred in thin patients

#### Glitazones (Thiazolidienediones)
- Include
	- Troglitazone
	- Rosiglitazone
	- Pioglitazone
- Acts by stimulating **PPAR-$\gamma$**  $\rightarrow$ Reversal of Insulin ressitance
- S/E
	- Hepatotoxic
		- Max hepatotoxic  $\rightarrow$ Troglitazone (withdrawn)
		- Rosiglitazone and Pioglitazone requires LFT monitoring
	- Na<sup>+</sup> and Water retention  $\rightarrow$ avoided in CHF and HTN
	- $\uparrow$ risk of <u>MI</u> by <u>Rosiglitazone</u>
	- $\uparrow$ risk of <u>Urinary bladder carcinoma</u> by <u>Pioglitazone</u>

#### $\alpha$-glucosidase inhibitors
- $\downarrow$ Intestinal absorption of carbohydrates
- Drugs
	- Acarbose
	- Miglitol
	- Voglibose
- MC side effect  $\rightarrow$ Flatulence
- C/I in Inflammatory bowel disease
	- Ulcerative colitis
	- Crohn's disease
- Hypoglycemia in presence of $\alpha$ glucosidase inhibitor  $\rightarrow$ **treat only by glucose**

### Newer antidiabetics

#### Incretin mimetics
- Incretin  $\rightarrow$ Physiological substances cause insulin release after meal
- Most important endogenous incretin  $\rightarrow$ GLP (Glucagon like peptide)
- GLP functions
	- Increase insulin release
	- Decrease gastric motility
	- Stimulate satiety center of brain
	- Inhibit apoptosis of $\beta$-cells
- GLP is metabolized by DPP-4 and inactivated
- In diabetes GLP is not secreted enough. So we use
	- GLP analogues
	- DPP-4 inhibitors

##### GLP analogues
- Drugs
	- Exenatide
	- Liraglutide
	- Albiglutide
	- Dulaglutide
	- Semaglutide
- Special facts about some drugs
	- Teduglutide
		- GLP2 analogue
		- Given subcutaneously
		- Given for short bowel syndrome as it delays gastric emptying
	- Semaglutide
		- Only GLP analogue that can be given orally
		- Causes weight loss
	- Liraglutide
		- Approved for obesity
		- Risk of hypoglycemia is very less

- Side effects
	- Acute pancreatitis (major side effect)
	- Nausea (most common)
	- Increased risk of <u>Medullary carcinoma thyroid</u>

##### DPP-4 inhibitors
- Drugs
	- Sitagliptin
	- Vildagliptin
	- Alogliptin
	- Linagliptin
	- Dapaliptin
	- Saxagliptin
- Gliptins are oral anti-diabetics
- Cause *weight loss* but **no hypoglycemia**
- Side effects
	- Nasopharyngitis (Most Common)
	- Pancreatitis
- Contraindications
	- Renal failure
	- <u>Linagliptin is saef in renal failure</u>

#### SGLT-2 Inhibitors
- Glucose is freely filtered by glomerulus by reabsorbed by *SGLT-2* in the *PCT*
- SGLT-2 inhibitors cause <u>glycosuria</u>
- Drugs
	- Canagliflozin
	- Dapagliflozin
	- Empagliflozin
	- Ertugliflozin
- Adverse effects
	- Urosepsis  $\rightarrow$ may lead to Fourneir's gangrene
	- If taken by Type 1 diabetics, blood sugar is nomal. If patient stops taking isulin, complete abscence of insulin causes **Diabetic ketoacidosis**

#### Amylin analogues
- Secreted by $\beta$ cells
- $\downarrow$ Blood sugar
- **Pramlinitide** is an amylin analogue given **SC**
- Side effect  $\rightarrow$ Hypoglycamia
- Approved both T1DM and T2DM
> Only two drugs can be given in T1DM  $\rightarrow$ Pramlinitide and Insulin

#### Brocriptine
- Decreases insulin resistance
- It has been recently approved for T2DM
- Given in **small dose** and taken **early morning**
- $\uparrow$ early morning dopaminergic activity and $\downarrow$ sympathetic activity  $\rightarrow$ Restores insulin sensitivity
