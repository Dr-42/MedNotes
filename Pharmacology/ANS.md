# ANS
## Parasympathomimetics

### Directly Acting
- Acetyl Choline
	- Short Acting  $\rightarrow$ **Not suitable for use**
- Carbachol
- Bethanechol
	- Acts on M<sub>3</sub>  $\rightarrow$ Atonic **B**ladder
- Methacholine
	- Acts on M<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$ **M**yocardium  $\rightarrow$ *Tachyarrhythmias*
- Pilocarpine
	- Acts on M<sub>2</sub>  $\rightarrow$ **P**upil  $\rightarrow$ Glaucoma
- Cevimeline
	- Acts on M<sub>3</sub>  $\rightarrow$ Sjogren Syndrome
> Bethanecol, Methacholine and Pilocarpine have no nicotinic receptor action
> Carbechol has both muscarinic and Nicotinic action

### Indirectly Acting

Two types
- Irreversible  $\rightarrow$ Poisons, not used as drugs
- Reversible  $\rightarrow$ Used clinically

#### Reversible AchE inhibitors

- Physostigmine
	- Lipid soluble
	- Usable in GIT, CNS, Eye
	- Used in glaucoma  $\rightarrow$ Miosis of eye
	- Crosses BBB  $\rightarrow$ TOC Atropine poisoning as atropine is also lipid soluble
- Tachrine
	- Lipid solubel AChE#
	- Tacrine has >99% entry to brain  $\rightarrow$ CNS specific
	- Short acting
	- Basal Nucleus of Meynert is responsible for memory  $\rightarrow$ Has a lot of cholinergic neurons  $\rightarrow$ damaged in [Alzheimer's](Pharmacology/Misc.md#Drugs%20for%20Alzheimers)
- Edrophonium
	- Water soluble AChE#
	- Edrophonium test/Tensilon test
		- Administer Edrophnium
		- If condition improves  $\rightarrow$ Myasthenia gravis
		- If condition worsens  $\rightarrow$ Cholinergic crisis
	- Action only 10min. So doesn't cause severe problems in cholinergic crisis
- Neostigmine
	- Water soluble  $\rightarrow$ Quaternary amine
	- No CNS activity
	- Treatment of Myasthenia grivis in combination with Atropine
		- Atropine given to block Muscarinic side effects
	- Treatment of Cobra bite
		- Cobra bit  $\rightarrow$ Neurotoxic
		- Blocks N<sub>M</sub> receptors in NMJ
		- TOC is **antivenom**
	- Reversal of muscle relaxants like Atracurium and Pancurium
	- Post-op paralytic ileus
	- Post-op urinary retention

## AChE Reactivators  $\rightarrow$ Oxinmes
- Can only be Organophosphates and not carbamates since carbamates are huge molecules and oximes can't displace them
- Examples
	- Pralidoxime
		- Only perpheral action
	- Diacetyl monoxime
		- Peripheral + Central action
- Cannot be given late as the OP + Enzyme bond becomes too strong and oximes can't work

## Anticholinergics

### M<sub>1</sub> blockers
- Drugs
	- Pirenzepine
	- Telenzapine
- Used in Peptic Ulcer disease as they are selective M<sub>1</sub> blockers
- Atropine not used d/t systemic side effects

### M<sub>2</sub> blockers
- Effects
	- Increased rate  $\rightarrow$ Used for bradycardia
	- Increased conduction  $\rightarrow$ Used for AV block
- Atropine used for this action

### M<sub>3</sub> blockers
- Respiratory
	- Inhalational M<sub>3</sub># will cause Bronchodilation
	- Ipratropium
	- Tiotropium
	> Atropine causes inhibition of both pre-synaptic and post synaptic fibres. So there is initial broncho-constriction due to pre-sympathetic block called **Transient Bronchoconstriction**. Later post synaptic block takes over with net bronchodilation
	> In case nebuliser has impurities like <u>Benzalkonium, EDTA or Hypertonic Saline</u>, Transient Bronchoconstriction will remain for a very long time
- Bladder
	- Used treatment of overactive bladder
	- **S**olifenacin
		- $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ Vescicoselctive
	- **O**xybutin
		- Relaxes the bladder directly too
	- **F**lavoxate
		- Relaxes the bladder directly too
	- **F**esoterodine
	- **T**olterodine
	- **T**rospium
		- Excreted by kidney  $\rightarrow$ CI in renal failure
	- **D**arifenacin
		- $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ $\uparrow$ Vescicoselctive
> SOFT blaDder
- Glands
	- M<sub>3</sub> block in glands will cause
		- Dry skin
		- Dry mouth
		- Dry eyes
		- $\downarrow$ sweating  $\rightarrow$ Hyperthermia (Atropine fever)  $\rightarrow$ Fatal in children
	- Hence atropine is contraindicated in children
