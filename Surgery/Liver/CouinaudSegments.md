# Basis
Liver is divided into 8 segments on the basis of:
- Portal Vein
- Hepatic Vein
## Relations
- Gall Bladder is close to Segment IV<sub>b</sub> & V.
```
In Ca Gall Bladder, These are involved early and are removed in extended cholecystectomy
```

## Lobes

- Right Lobe
	- V, VI, VII, VIII
	- Right Ant. Sector - V, VIII
	- Right Post. Sector - VI, VII
- Left Lobe
	- II, III, IV
	- Left Ant. Sector - III, IV<sub>a</sub>, IV<sub>b</sub>
	- Left Post. Sector - II
		
```
Hence in Hepatectomy, The respective lobes are removed
```

- Extra segments:
	- Segment I - [[#Caudate Lobe]]
	- Segment IV - Quadrate Lobe

## Trisegementectomy

Extended hepatectomy
- Right - V, VI, VII, VIII, IV<sub>a</sub>, IV<sub>b</sub>.
- Left - II, III, IV<sub>a</sub>, IV<sub>b</sub>, V, VIII.

## Caudate Lobe
- Latest research shows actually 9 segements.
- Segement IX is paracaval portion of Caudate

- Parts of Caudate Lobe
	- Speigel Lobe - Segement I
	- Paracaval Portion - Segmenet IX
	- Caudate Process
-  Unique properties
	- Recieves blood supply from both the left and right branches of Portal vein (Mainly Left branch though)
	- Give Biliary drainage to both left and right hepatic ducts (Mainly left)
	- **Venous drainage directly in IVC**
