	3. Dispersion of cholesterol occurs by physiochemical means
- Indications for medical management
	- For cholesterol stones
	- Size < 10mm
	- Non-acute symptoms
	- Functioning GB
- Medical management is usually <u><b>not recommended</b></u> because
	- Long duration of treatment
	- Increased cost
	- High recurrance

- Asymptomatic
- MC site of _fistula_ - **Cholecystoduodenal** > Cholecystocolic
- MC site of obstruction - Terminal ileum

#### Pathophysiology
1. Large stone in GB
2. Causes inflammation and erosion of GB wall
3. Leads to fistula formation between GB and Duodenum
4. Stone moves to GIT and causes obstruction in its narrowest part (Terminal ileum) causing 
5. _**Plain X-ray triad**_ / _**Reigler's Triad**_
	1. Small bowel obstruction
	2. Ectopic gall stone
