## Gall Stones

### General
- MC type of gall stone worldwide - Mixed > Cholesterol
- MC type of gall stone in Asia - Pigmented (Combined black and brown)
- Gall stones have a triradiate fissure - **Mercedes Benz Sign**
	![[MercedesBenzSign.jpg]]
- Gall stones have a biradiate fissure - **Sea gull sign**
### Types
#### Cholesterol gall stones
- MC type
- Requires 3 mandatory factors
	- Lithogenic bile
		- Increased biliary cholesterol
			- Obesity
			- High cholesterol intake
			- Clofibate therapy
		- Decreased bile acid
			- Ileal resection
				- Terminal ileum is involved in B12 reabsorption and enterohepatic circulation of bile ssalts
			- Ileal disease
			- Bile acid sequesterants
				- Cholestyramine
				- Colestipol
			- *CYP7A-1 gene* mutation
		- Decreased **Lecithin**
			- _MDR-3_ gene mutation
	- Nucleation
		- Promoting factors
			- Infection
			- Mucin glycoproteins
	- Stasis
		- Prolonged fasting
		- Prolonged TPN
		- Pregnancy
		- Octreotide
		- OCP
		- Massive burns
- Composition - Crystalline **cholesterol monohydrate**

#### Pigmented gall stones
- Types
	- Black
		- Insoluble bilirubin pigment polymer of <b><u>Calcium Phosphate and Calcium bicarbonate</u></b>
		- Properties
			- Hard
			- _Radiopaque_
		- Risk Factors
			- Chronic hemolytic conditions
			- Heriditary spherocytosis
			- Prosthetic Heart Valves
			- Gilbert Syndrome
	- Brown
		- Composed of
			- Calcium biliruniate
			- Calcium palmitate
			- Calcium stearate
		- MC in CBD
		- Rare in gall bladder
		- MC in developing countries 
			- Due to increased risk of worm infestations like _Ascaris_, _Clonorchis sinensis_.
		- Pathophysiology
			1. Dead product in CBD (Dead worms trapped)
			2. Infection by _E. coli_ and _Klebsiella_
			3. $\beta$-glucuronidase is produced
			4. Converts conjugated bilirubin to unconjugated
			5. Brown stones
### Investigations
- IOC
	- Gall stone - USG
	- Acute cholecystitis - USG
	- Acute acalculous cholecystitis - USG
	- Chronic cholecystitis - USG
- Gold standard for Dx of acute cholecystitis
	- **HIDA scan**
	- Dx. criteria for acutecholecystitis in HIDA - Non-visualisation of GB
### Medical management of Gall stones
- UCDA - Ursodeoxycholic acid
- CDCA - Chenodeoxycholic acid
- Mechanism
	1. Inhibit HMG-Co-A reductase (rate limiting enzyme)
	2. Decrease cholesterol synthesis
	3. Dispersion of cholesterol occurs by physiochemical means
- Indications for medical management
	- For cholesterol stones
	- Size < 10mm
	- Non-acute symptoms
	- Functioning GB
- Medical management is usually <u><b>not recommended</b></u> because
	- Long duration of treatment
	- Increased cost
	- High recurrance

### Prophylactic Cholecystectomy
- Indications
	- Heart Transplant
		- Cyclosporine given - Increased risk of gall stones
	- Lung Transplant

## Acute Cholecystitis
- Characterised by a triad of 
	- Right upper quadrant pain
	- Fever
	- Leukocytosis
- Minimum duration 24hr
- Not relieved on its own
- **Murphy's Sign/Nauyn's sign** - When 9th costal cartilage is pressed there is a catch in inspiration
- **Tokyo guidelines** used for severity grading
- Diagnosis
	- IOC - USG
		- >4mm thickness of GB wall
	- Gold standard - HIDA scan
- Treatment
	- Pateints presents within 72hrs - Conservative management f/b in hospital or same sitting cholecystectomy
	- After 72hrs - Conservative management f/b **interval lap cholecystectomy** (after 4-6 weeks)
