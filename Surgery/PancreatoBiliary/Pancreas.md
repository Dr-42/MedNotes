### Pathophysiology
```mermaid
graph TD

n1(Abnormal intra-pancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes)
n2(These pancreatic enzymes have lipase which digest the fat of the greater omentum)
n3(Fat is converted to fatty acid and glycerol)
n4(fatty acids combine with Ca<sup>2+</sup> to form chalky white deposits : Saponification)
n5(Hypocalcemia)


n1 --> n2
n2 --> n3
n3 --> n4
n4 --> n5
```

### General
- It is mild and self limited in majoriy of cases
- Mild AP < 1% mortality
- Severer AP : 10-30% mortality
- <u><b>Gall stone induced pancreatitis has the best prognosis</b></u>
- MC cause of death in Acute Pancreatitis
	- Within 2 weeks of hospitalization - MODS (Multi Organ Dysfunction Syndrome)
		- Initial sign of MODS - Impaired Lung Function (ARDS)
	- After 2 weeks of hospitalization - Sepsis

### Clinical Feautures
- Pain in Epigastrium, radiating to left side of back and partially releived by sitting or bending forward
- Due to Paralytic Ileus - there is Nausea, vomiting and abdominal distension
	- Sign of Paralytic ileus on Xray

	- Grey turner sign - ecchymosis around flank
	- Fox sign - ecchymosis around inguinal region
	![[EcchymoticSignsAcutePancreatitis.jpg]]
### Diagnosis
- IOC : CECT
	- Reserved for complications
	- Best time - After 72 hrs
- Diagnosis is usually made with clinical findings and laboratory investigations
	- Amylase (not very specific)
		- Raised in non-pancreatic causes
		- No correlation between level of amylase and severity
	- Lipase
		- More specific
	
### Management
- Fluid resusctitation - Fluid of choice is **Ringer Lactate**
- O<sub>2</sub> supplementation
- Analgesics
	- NSAIDS → Metamizole
	- OPIOIDS → Buprenorphine
- Nutrition: Enteral nutrition > TPN
- Indication of TPN
	- Shock
	- Sever Acute Pancreatitis
- Prophylactic antibiotics should not be used

### Local Complications of Acute Pancreatitis according to <u>Revised Atlanta Classification</u>

- Acute < 4 weeks
	- No defined wall
	- Complicated to Acute Pancreatic fluid collection
	- Resolves spontaneously
	- Some cases after 4 weeks develops into pancreatic pseudocyst
- Chronic > 4 weeks
	- Pseudocyst
	- Walled of necrosis
- Pancreatic Abscess
	- Pus collection in peripancreatic region
	- Treatment
		- USG/CT guided percutaneous aspiration
		- Antibiotics
- Pancreatic necrosis
	- Non-viable pancreatic tissue or peripancreatic fat
	- It is a sterile condition
	- MC complication is infection
	- MC organism responsible in _E. coli_
	- Drugs with good pancreatic penetration power are Carbapenems
		- Imipenem
		- Meropenem
	- Management
		- Repeated necrostomy
		- Surgical debridement with ongoing lavage
- Pancreatic Pseudocyst
	- MC ystic lesion of pancreas
	- It is a false cyst (Lined with granulation tissue)
	- MC cause of pseudocyst - Alcohol
	- MC site - Lesser sac
	- Pseudocyst can be seen in both Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis
		- In Acute Pancreatitis
			- Single
			- Large
			- Extra-pancreatic
			- Incidence - 10 - 12%
		- In Chronic Pancreatitis
			- Multiple
			- Small
			- Intra-pancreatic
			- 20 - 40%
	- Clinical Features
		- In most patients pseudocyst is small hence asymptomatic
		- In symptomatic patients
			- MC symptom - Abdominal pain
			- Vomiting (Non bilious) containing undigested food partiles
	- Complications
		- MC is infection (14%) > Hemorrhage (10%)
	- Diagnosis
		- IOC - CECT
	- Treatment
		- Observation - Most resolve spontaneously
		- Indications for surgery
			- Duration > 6 weeks
			- Size >= 6cm
		- Surgery
			- Cysto-jejunostomy - TOC (Best Results)
				![[Cystojejunostomy.jpg]]
				- Advantages
					- Drainage along gravity
					- No formation of SUMP syndrome
				- Disadvantages
					- Increased duration of surgery
					- Increased bloo loss
			- Cysto-gastrostomy - MC performed
				![[Cystogastrostomy.jpg]]
				- Disadvantages
					- Drainage against gravity
					- Since the drainage is against gravity, food may enter pseudocyst and cause infection (bacterial overgrowth) leading to SUMP
			- Cysto-duodenostomy
## Chronic Pancreatitis
### General
- Characterised by irreversible fibrosis of pancreatic parenchyma with ongoing inflammation
	- Exocrine insuffiency
		- It precedes endocrine insufficiency
		- > 90% acini permanantly destroyed
		- Leads to
			- Indigestion
			- Malabsorption
			- Steatorrhea
	- Endocrine insuffiency
		- > 90% of islet cells permanently destroyed
		- Leads to DM
	- Chronic pain
- Causes
	- MC cause - Heavy alcohol consumption
		- Smoking has synergestic effect
### Clinical Features
- MC symptom is Abdominal pain
- Characterized by triad
	- **D**iabetes Mellitus
	- **P**ancreatic Calcification
		- Calcifications present in 30% to 40% cases
	- **S**teatorrhoea
### TIGARO Classification of Etiology
- **T** - Toxic - Metabolic
- **I** - Idiopathic
- **G** - Genetic
- **A** - Autoimmune
- **R** - Recurrent severe acute pancreatitis
- **O** - Obstructive
### Diagnosis
- IOC - MRCP
- Gold standard - ERCP
- On ERCP
	- Shows alternate stricture and dilation of pancreatic duct with pancreatic stones enclosing giving <b><u>String of pearls/Chain of lakes/Beaded</b></u> appearance
		![[ChainofLakes_chronicPancreatitis.jpg]]
	- Composition of stone - **Ca(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
- Endoscopic USG - Most accurate investigation for diagnosis of minimal change in chronic panreatitis
- <b><u>ROSEMENT criteria</b></u> is based on endoscopic USG findings
![[PancreaticCalcifications.jpg]]
### Management
- Exocrine insufficiency - Enteric coated pancreatic enzyme supplementation
- Endocrine insufficiency - Insulin
- Pain - Analgesics
	- NSAIDS - Metamizole
	- Opioids - Buprenorphine
- If Pain not relieved with analgesics: ERCP stenting/oblique stone removal
- Pain not relieved with ERCP and stenting: Celiac Ganglion blockade
- Pain not relieved with Celiac Ganglion Blockade: Surgery
### Surgery
- Drainage Procedure
	- Puestow's procedure
		- Also called LPJ (Longitudinal Pancreaticojejunostomy)
		- Opening pancreatic duct and suture with jejunum
- Resection Procedure
	- Berger's Procedure
		- Also called DPPHR - Duodenal preserving pancreatic head resection
		- After shaving the pancreatic head, suture the body with jejunum
		- Has maximum pain relief
	- Frey's Procedure
		- Also called LRLPJ - Local resection of Pancreatic head with Longitudinal pancreatic jejunostomy
