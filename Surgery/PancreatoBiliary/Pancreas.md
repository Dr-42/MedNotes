```mermaid
graph TD

n1(Abnormal intra-pancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes)
n2(These pancreatic enzymes have lipase which digest the fat of the greater omentum)
n3(Fat is converted to fatty acid and glycerol)
n4(fatty acids combine with Ca<sup>2+</sup> to form chalky white deposits : Saponification)
n5(Hypocalcemia)


n1 --> n2
n2 --> n3
n3 --> n4
n4 --> n5
```
