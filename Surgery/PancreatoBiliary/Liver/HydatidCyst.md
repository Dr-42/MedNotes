## General
- It is a zoonosis primarily occuring in sheep rearing countries.
- Endemic in Mediterrenian countries, South America, New Zealand, and East Africa.
- Caused by
	- *Echinococcus granulosus* (MC)
	- *E. multilocularis*
		- Responisble for <u>malignant hydatidosis</u>
		- Slow growing alveolar tumor
	- *E. vogeli*
	- *E. oligarthus*
- Host
	- Definitive host - <u>Dog</u> (Sexual phase)
	- Intermediate host - <u>Sheep</u> 
	- Man :
		- Accidental host
		- Dead end host
		- Intermediate host
		- No human to human transmission occurs
- Route of infection - Feco-oral
- Infective stage - Egg of Echinococcus

## Life cycle
![[Hydatid Life Cycle.jpg]]

## Clinical Features
- Equal distribution (Man == Woman)
- Most patients - Asymptomatic
- MC presentation - Asymptomatic palpable intra-abdominal mass (Hepatomegaly)
- In symptomatic patients
	- Abdominal pain (MC)
	- Abdominal discomfort
	- Dyspepsia
- MC complication
	- Intra-biliary rupture

## Diagnosis
- First investigation - USG
- Dx highly confirmed by
	- USG - **Rosette appearance**
		![[HydatidUSG.jpg]]
	- CT - **Ring like calcification**
		![[HydatidCT.jpg]]
- IOC - Hydatid Serology (>95% specificity and sensitivity)
	- ELISA
	- ARC - 5
	- Immunoblot
- Casoni Test
	- Not used
	- Low sensitivity (55% - 60%)
	- Risk of anaphylaxis
## Treatment
- DOC for perioperative chemoprophylaxix
	- Albendazole > Mebendazole
- Albendazole is scoliocidal and shrinks cyst size

## Surgical Intervention
- PAIR
	- Steps
		- Puncture
		- Aspiration of content
		- Instillation of scoliocidal
		- Reaspiration
	- Most preferred technique for anatomically and surgically appropritate lesions
	- Scoliocidals used 
		- Hypertonic saline (20%) MC
		- 0.5% cetrimide with 0.5% chlorhexidine
		- 10% povidone iodine
		- Absolute alcohol
	- Contraindications
		- Inaccessible cyst
		- Multiloculated cyst
		- Peripherally located cyst
		- Cyst in lung and brain (Don't have a pericyst)
		- Calcified (Dead) cyst
- Cyst evacuation + Omentopexy

```
If the surgeon doesn't want to attach the omentum, obliteration of the cyst cavity is done by sutures. This is known as cartilage/intro flexion
```

- Pericystectomy
	![[HydatidPericystectomy.jpg]]
	- Most effective treatment
	- Excision of cyst outside pericyst
- Hepatic Resection
	- Most radical
