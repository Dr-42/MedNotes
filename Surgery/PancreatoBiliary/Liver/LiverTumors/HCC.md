# HCC
## Risk Factors

| Cirrhosis                | Metabolic Disorders        | Environmental Factors |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| HBV                      | Hemochromatosis            | Cigarette smoking     |
| HCV                      | Wilson's Disease           | Anabolic Steoids      |
| Alcohol                  | Glycogen Storage Disorders | Thorotrast            |
| NAFLD                    | $\alpha1$ AT Deficiency    |                       |
| Chronic Active Hepatitis | Porphyria Cutanea Tarda    |                       |
|                          | Citrullinemia              |                       |
|                          | Orotic Aciduria            |                       |
|                          | Alagille's Syndrome        |                       |
> Thorotrast also increases the risk of:
 > - Cholangiocarcinoma
 > -  HCC
 > - Angiosarcoma
 > - Hepatic Fibrosis

## General
- MC malignancy of liver (M >>> F)
- Common in male
- 5th - 6th decade
- MC cause - HBV
- HBV induced HCC is decreasing because of vaccination
- HCV induced HCC increasing in western countries
	- Causes:
	- Blood Tx
	- Sexual transmission
	- Associated with HIV
- HCC has propensity for Vascular invasion (like RCC)
	- Tumor invades from one branch of Portal Vein to another causing **Multicentric & Bilobar** spread (75% to 80% cases)
	- This happens because Portal veins are valveless

## Pathological Types
1. Hanging - Best prognosis
2. Pushing
3. Infiltrative - MC, Worst Prognosis

## Clinical Features
- Abdominal pain (MC Symptom)
- Weight Loss
- Other symptoms (Less common)
	- Anorexia
	- Fatigue
	- Jaundice (10%)
	- Tumor rupture (3%-5%)
	- Hypervascular - Audible bruit (20%-25%)
	- Paraneoplastic Manifestation
		- Hypercholesterolemia (MC)
		- Hypoglycemia
		- Erythrocytosis
		- Hypercalcemia
## Tumor Markers
1. AFP > 20ng/mL (seen in 70%)
2. Increased PIVKA-2 (Protein induced by VitK Abscence - 2)

## Diagnosis
- First investigation done in suspected HCC - **USG**
- IOC - Triple phase CT
	- Arterial Hypervascularization with venous washout

## Staging
1. Okuda Classification
	- **B**ilirubin
	- **A**lbumin
	- **T**umor size
	- **A**scites
2. CLIP (Cancer Liver Italian Program)
	- **P**ortal Vein Thrombosis
	- **A**FP
	- **T**umor Extension
3. CUPI (Chinese University Prognostic Index)
	- **B**ilirubin
	- **A**FP
	- **A**scitis
	- **A**LP
	- **T**NM Staging
	- **S**ymptoms
## Management
- **BCLC** (Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer): Based on OKUDA and patient performance status
- For unresectable tumor - Palliation
- For Resectable tumor
	- With adequete Hepatic reserve - Resection
	- With inadequete Hepatic reserve - Transplantation
- Milian's criteria for Liver Transplantation in HCC
	- Criteria: 
		1. Single tumor < 5cm in size
		2. Multiple tumors (2-3) < 3cm each
		3. No extrahepatic/vascular spread
	-  If a person fulfils this criteria - 5 year survival rate 70%
- Palliation for unresectable tumors
	- Percutaneous ethanol injection
	- Percutaneous Acetic Acid Injection
	- Radiofrequency Ablation
	- Microwave ablation
	- Cryoablation (using liquid Nitrogen)
	- TACE (Trans Arterial Chemo Embolization)
		- Only palliative method with survival advantage
		- Local delivery of chemotherapeutic agent obstructs hepatic artery. Since HCC is exclusively supplied by hepatic artery - Survival advantage
	- Cisplatin
	- Doxorubicin
	- **Sorafenib** for advanced and metastatic HCC
## Fibrolamellar variant of HCC
- SE Asia/India - F > M
- Worldwide - F == M
- Well circumscribed and non-encapsulated tumor
- Has slow growth
- Present in young patients
- Not associated with
	- HBV
	- HCV
	- Cirrhosis
- Good prognosis
- Pathology 
	- Has fibrous stroma with lamellar structures
	- AFP is normal, but raised <u><b>Neurotensin and B12 binding globulin</b></u>
- Diagnosis
	- IOC - CECT
		- Shows central stellate scar
- Treatment
	- In majority of cases it has good prognosis
	- Tumor is resectable
