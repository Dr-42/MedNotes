# Liver Mets
## GI Embroyo
- GIT develops from : 
	1. Foregut - cricopharynx to 2<sup>nd</sup> part of duodenum
		- Blood supply - Celiac trunk
		- Branches
			1. Left gastric artery
			2. Splenic Artery
			3. Common Hepatic Artery
		- These branches have corresponding veins which drain into the portal vein directly or indirectly
	2. Midgut - 2<sup>nd</sup> part of duodenum to $\frac{2}{3}$<sup>rd</sup> transverse colon.
		- Blood supply - Superior Mesenteric Artery
		- Superior mesenteric Vein - Drains into Portal vein
	3. Hindgut - $\frac{1}{3}$<sup>rd</sup> transverse colon to anorectal junction
		- Blood Supply - Inferior Mesenteric Artery
		- Inferior mesenteric Vein - Drains into Portal vein
- Hence Liver acts as a filter organ for the entire GI. Any hematogenous spread will arrive at liver first.
