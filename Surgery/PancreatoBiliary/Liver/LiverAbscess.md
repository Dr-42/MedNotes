# Liver Abscess
## Pyogenic Liver Abscess (PLA)

### General
- M/C type of liver abscess
- Liver is the most common solid organ involved by pyogenic abscess
- Presents in 5<sup>th</sup> - 6<sup>th</sup> decade.
- **More common in Alcoholic males**
- MC Organism:
	- Worldwide - *E. coli*
	- Asia - *Klebsiella*
	- Children - *S. aureus* (Children suffering from chronic granulamatous disease)
- In PLA obstruction, jaundice is commmon (25%)
- Most common LFT abnormality - ↑↑ ALP

### Routes of infections
1. Bile duct (MC)
	- Cholangitis
		- CBD Stones (MC cause of cholangitis)
		- Hilar cholangiocarcinoma
2. Portal Vein
	- Appendicular perf
	- Diverticulitis
	- These increase the risk of PLA
3. Hepatic Artery
	- Children suffering from chronic granulomatous disease have defective neutrophil function. Hence have inc. rist of SABE (Sub Acute Bacterial Infection). Infection reaches liver via hepatic artery.
4. Direct extension from
	- Pyothorax
	- Sub-diaphragmatic Abscess
	- **Acute suppurative cholecystitis**
	- Preinephric Abscess
	
### Clinical Features
- Fever with chills (MC)
- Abdominal pain
- Anorexia
- Fatigue (Most chracterestic symptom)
- Jaundice in 20% - 25% cases
### Lab parameters
Any kind of CBD obstruction, 3 parameters are always raised
- ALP (MC LFT Abnormality)
- GGT
- 5' Nucleotidase

### Diagnosis
- First investigation - USG
- Dx highly suggested by USG and CT
- IOC - Aspiration and Culture.

### Treatment
- Percutaneous catheter drainage + Systemic Antibiotics

## Amoebic Liver Abscess
### General
- Organism - *Entamoeba histolytica*
- MC in developing countries
- MC route - Feco-oral
- Infective stage - Quadrinucleate cyst
```
Quadrinucleate cyst -> Octanucleate cyst -> 8 trhozoites -> Flask shaped ulcers
```

- Caecum and Ascending colon MC location of
	- Flask shaped ulcer
	- Amoebic colitis
	- Amoeba
- *E. histolytica* reaches liver via SMA or Portal vein
- It cause histolysis of hepatocytes and necrosis by WBC - Giving **Anchovy suace pus**
### Clinical Features
- MC - Abdominal Pain
- Fever
- Anorexia
- Fatigue
- Jaundice (Rare)
- MC LFT Abnormality - ↑↑  PT time
### Diagnosis
- First investigation - USG
- Dx confirmed by - Amoebic serology
### Treatment
- High dose <u><b>oral Metronidazole 750mg TDS for 10-14 days</b></u>
- Indication for aspiration
	- No improvement after medical management within 3-5 days
	- High risk abscess
		- Left lobe abscess
		- Size > 5cm
	- Diagnostic uncertainty
	- Bacterial superinfection
	- Pregnancy (High dose Metronidazole is not safe)
- Treatment for carriers
	- Carriers are <u>asymptomatic cyst passers</u>
	- Intraluminal agents are used
		- Paromomycin
		- Iodoquinol
		- Diloxanide furoate
### Complications
- Rupture into peritoneal cavity (MC site of rupture)
	- Rx- Exp. Laprotomy + Peritoneal Lavage + Drain insertion
- Rupture into pleural cavity
	- Rx - ICD insertion
- Rupture into pericardial cavity
	- Rx - Needle pericardiocentesis f/b pericardiotomy
