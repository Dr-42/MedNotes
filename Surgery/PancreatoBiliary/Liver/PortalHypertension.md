# Portal Hypertension
## General
- Normal portal pressure - 5-10mm Hg or 10-15 cm of saline
- **Definition** - <u>Portal pressure > 10mmHg</u>
- Universal manifestations
	- Esophageal varices
	- Splenomegaly
---
> Esophageal varices bleed at portal pressure > 12mmHg
> Esophageal varices form at portal pressure >  10mmHg
---
- MC cause worldwide - Cirrhosis
- MC cause in children - Extrahepatic portal venous obstruction
- Causes of increased pressures
	- Increased resistance
	- Increased flow

## Liver Anatomy
- Area where blood from portal vein and hepatic artery mix - **Sinusoid**
- Sinusoid is surrounded by _Hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and Bile canaliculi_

> Sinusoidal causes include causes of cirrhosis

## Diagnosis
- Doppler is IOC

## Portal systemic anastomotic sites
![[PortalAnastomses.jpg]]

- Esophageal varices
	- Left Gastric vein (Coronary vein)
	- Azygous vein
- Rectal varices
	- Superior rectal vein
	- Inferior rectal vein
	- Medial rectal vein
- Caput medusae
	- Superior epigastric vein
	- Inferior epigastric vein
	- Paraunblical vein
> Audible venous hump at caput medusae is known as **_Cruveilheir-Baumgarten murmur_**
> MC cause of deaath in cirrhosis: Hepatic failure > Variceal bleeding

## Variceal bleeding
- MC site - lower 3cm of esophagus
- Coffee colored bleeding (as venous blood is mixed with gastric acid)
### Management
- As patient goes to shock after 2-3 episodes of bleed
	- Put 2 large bore IV canulas
	- Start IV fluids
	- Fluid of choice - Ringer Lactate
	- Cut off BP - 100mmHg
	- Cub off HB - 8gm%
- Indication for Blood Transfusion - Hb < 8gm%
- Pharmacotherapy
	- DOC for controlling bleeding - Octreotide > Terlipressin + nitrates
	- Gastric lavage - room temperature saline
	> Cold saline should not be used as it causes hypothermia causing platelet sysfunction d/t platelet dysfunction

- First investigation in any upper GI bleed - Endoscopy
	- Endoscopy > EVL (Endoscopic Variceal Ligation) > Endoscopic sclerotherapy
	- Endoscopic sclerotherapy - Easy to perform but increased risk of esophageal perforation
- IV antibiotics given for 7 days
	- Decreased risk of infections
	- Decreased duration of hospitalisation
	- Decreased risk of rebleeding
- If bleeding is not controlled
	- Repeat endoscopy
	- Surgical intervention - TIPPS / Shunt
- If 2 attempts of endoscopy failed - Surgical intervention

## For transportation from rural areas
- Sengstaken Blakemore tube
	- Triple lumen baloon tube
	- Steps of use
		1. Gastric baloon filled with 50mL air
		2. Esophageal baloon filled with 250mL of air
	- Only air is used. 
		- Water, Saline, Contrast - Cntraindicated
	- MC complication - Aspiration
	- Max Pressure - 35 - 40 mmHg
	- Every 12 hrs, esophageal baloon deflated to prevent esophageal ischemia.
	![[SengstakenBlakemoreTube.jpg]]	
- Linton's Nachalas tube
	- Single baloon tube
	- Capacity - 400 - 700 mL
	- Use - **Isolated gastric varices**

## TIPSS (Trans Jugular Intrahepatic Porto Systemic Shunt)
### General
- Non selective shunt
- Stent inserted between right hepatic vein and right branch of portal vein
- For canulation 
	- Internal Jugular Vein is preferred
	- **Rosch** needle is used
- Sten name - <u><b>VIATORR</b></u>
	![[TIPSS.jpg]]

### Complications
- Encephalopathy (due to NH<sub>3</sub>) - MC
- Stent stenosis
- Stent thrombosis

## Shunts
### Types:
- Non-selctive
	- Eck fistula
	- SSPCS (Side to side porta-caval shunt)
	- Inter position graft
		- Porto caval
		- Meso caval
		- Meso renal
	- PSRS (Proximal splenorenal shunt) / Linton's shunt
- Selective
	- DSRS (Distal splenorenal shunt) / Warren shunt
	- Inokuchi shunt
- Partial
### Non-selective shunts
#### Eck fistula
- End to side portocaval shunt
- Portal vein is divided
	- Proximal part is ligated
	- Distal part is anastomosed with IVC
- No blood flows from PV to Liver
- Increased risk of hepatic ischemia
- **OBSOLETE**
#### SSPCS
- Portal vein is divided into proximal and distal part - both anastomosed with IVC
- MC performed shunt
- Shunt of choice for
	- Refractory ascites
	- Budd Chiari syndrome
	- Veno-occlusive disease
#### Interposition graft
- Types
	- Porto caval - Between Portal vein and Vena cava
	- Meso caval - Between Portal SMV and Vena Cava
	- Meso renal - Between SMV and Splenic vein
#### Linton's Shunt (PSRS)
- Performed after splenectomy
- Suture proximal part of splenic vein to renal vein
### Selective Shunt
#### DSRS / Warren Shunt
- Distal splenorenal shunt
- Distal part of splenic vein is divided and sutured with renal vein

#### Inokuchi Shunt
- IP graft between **Left gastric vein** and **IVC** is done
- Interposition graft

### Peritoneo venous shunt
- Shunts used
	- Denver
	- Le Veen
	- Minnesota
- Usually in patients having refractory ascites
- Valves are present in this shunt so that only unidirectional flow should be possible
- Preferred vein - Right Internal Jugular > Superior Vena Cava

## Non-Cirrhotic Portal Hypertension
- Abscence of
	- Cirrhosis
	- Ascites
	- Jaundice
	- Encephalopathy
- Symptoms due to portal HTN
	- Variceal bleeding
		- MC presentation
		- MC cause of death
	- Splenomegaly
- Includes
	- EHPVO (Extra hepatic Portal Venous Obstruction)
	- NCPF (Non-Cirrhotic Portal Fibrosis)
### Difference between EHPVO and NCPF
| EHPVO                                                                            | NCPF                                                            |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> order branches are involved                    | Involvement of 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> order branches |
| MC site of obstruction - Confluence of splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein | Risk increased by<br>- Vinyl Chloride<br>- Arsenic<br>- Copper  |
| Seen in 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> decade                                 | Seen in 2<sup>nd</sup> - 4<sup>th</sup> decade                  |
| Splenomegaly is less common (Mild to Moderate)                                   | Splenomegaly is more common (Moderate to Massive)               |
## Budd Chiari Syndrome
### General
- Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
- Causes:
	- Hepatic Vein Thombosis
	- IVC obstruction
- Etiology
	- Polycythemia vera - Has hypercoagulabity causing thrombosis
- MC cause in western countries - HVT
- In India, China, Japan, South Africa - IVC obstruction

### Clinical Features
- Charateristic triad
	- **Ascites**
	- **Hepatomegaly**
	- **Abdominal pain**
- Other features:
	- Jaundice
	- Encephalopathy
	- Anorexia and fatigue
- In BCS caused by HVT, caudate lobe is spared since it has its own venous drainage
- In chronic cases, liver is atrophied and Caudate is hypertrophied -> Central hot spot sign on _Scintigraphy_

### Diagnosis
- IOC
	- Venography (If HVT)
		- shows spider web collaterals
	- Venocavagraphy (If IVC obs.)
### Treatment
- Thrombolysis (window period 2 - 3 weeks)
- Anticoagulants
- Most patients present after 2-3 weeks, hence thrombolysis is not useful
	- In HVT
		- SSPCS can be done
	- In IVC obs.
		- Trans cardiac membranotomy
		- Excision with grafting (in stenosis)
	- In IVC obs + HVT
		- SSPCS + Cava-atrial shunt
	- In hepatic failure
		- Liver transplantation (TOC)
## Veno-occlusive disease
### General
- Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
- Caused by endothelial sclerosis of sub lobular hepatic veins and venules
### Etiology
- MC cause in western countries - Bone Marrow Transplantation
- Chemotherapy agents
	- Cytarabine
	- Thioguanidine
	- Gemtuzumab
	- Ozogamucin
- Immunosuppresive agents 
	- Azathiorpine
- Consumption of _Bush teas_
	- Crotalaria
	- Contains **Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids**
### Clinical Feautres
- Tender Hepatomegaly
- Hyperbilirubinemia
- Retention of fluids
### Diagnosis
- IOC - Biopsy
### Management
- Only hepatic venous outflow obs. - SSPCS
- If patient in hepatic failure - Liver transplantation
- **Defibrotide** - improves survival
