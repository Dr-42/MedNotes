# Bile Duct
## Anatomy
- Common Hepatic Duct
	- Length →  1-4cm
	- Diameter →  4mm
- Common bile duct
	- Length → 1 - 4 cm
	- Diameter → 5-10mm
- Blood supply
	- Has coaxial blood supply
		- Blood supply is present at 3<sup>o'</sup> clock and 9<sup>o'</sup> clock position
		- Hence longitudinal incision is given in bile duct
	- Supraduaodenal bile duct gets blood supply from:
		- Inferior (60%)
			- Pancreatic duodenal artery
			- Retro duodenal artery
		- Superior (38%)
			- Right hepatic artery
			- Cystic duct artery
- Sphincter of Oddi complex
	1. Superior choledochal sphincter
	2. Inferior choldocal sphncter
	3. Sphincter ampulaae
	4. Sphincter pancreaticus

## Choledochal Cyst
### General
- Dilatation of bile duct
- Congenital
- MC in Children
### Pathophysiology
- Most accepted hypothesis - **APBDJ** (Abnormal pancreatico biliary duct junction)
	- Has long common channel
	- Reflux of pancreatic enzyme
	- Digestion of bile duct wall
	- Wall dilation
