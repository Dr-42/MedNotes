# Bile Duct
## Anatomy
- Common Hepatic Duct
	- Length →  1-4cm
	- Diameter →  4mm
- Common bile duct
	- Length → 1 - 4 cm
	- Diameter → 5-10mm
- Blood supply
	- Has coaxial blood supply
		- Blood supply is present at 3<sup>o'</sup> clock and 9<sup>o'</sup> clock position
		- Hence longitudinal incision is given in bile duct
	- Supraduaodenal bile duct gets blood supply from:
		- Inferior (60%)
			- Pancreatic duodenal artery
			- Retro duodenal artery
		- Superior (38%)
			- Right hepatic artery
			- Cystic duct artery
- Sphincter of Oddi complex
	1. Superior choledochal sphincter
	2. Inferior choldocal sphncter
	3. Sphincter ampulaae
	4. Sphincter pancreaticus

## Choledochal Cyst
### General
- Dilatation of bile duct
- Congenital
- MC in Children
### Pathophysiology
- Most accepted hypothesis - **APBDJ** (Abnormal pancreatico biliary duct junction)
	- Has long common channel
	- Reflux of pancreatic enzyme
	- Digestion of bile duct wall
	- Wall dilation
### Classification
- Todani Modification of Alonso-lej Classification

| Type | Description                                                              |
| :--- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ia   | Cystic dilation of extra hepatic bile duct (MC)                          |
| Ib   | Focal segmental dilatation of extra hepatic bile duct                    |
| Ic   | Fusiform dilatation of extra hepatic bile duct                           |
| II   | Diverticular dilatation of extrahepatic bile duct                        |
| III  | Dilatation of intraduodenal part of bile duct (Choledococele)            |
| IVa  | Dilatation of both intra and extra hepatic bile ducts                    |
| IVb  | Multiple cysts involving only extra hepatic bile duct                    |
| V    | Multiple cysts involving only intra hepatic bile duct (Caroli's disease) |
![[CholedochalCyst.jpg]]
- Type I - MC in 
	- Choledochal cyst
	- Hiatus hernia
	- Gastric ulcer
	- Fistula in Ano
	- Posterior urthral valve
- MC type of choledochal cyct → Type I > IV > III
- Type IV - cystic dilatation of cystic duct (not part of Todani classification)
### Treatment
- Type IVA and V → Liver transplantation
- Type I, II, IVb → Roux-en-Y Hepatico-jejunostomy
- Type III → Endoscopic sphincterotomy with cyst unroofing
### Clinical Features
- Mass + Pain + Jaundice (Intermittent jaundice)
- MC symptom in < 2 years of age → Jaundice
- MC symptom in > 2 years of age → Abdominal pain
- MC site of cholangiocarcinoma - Posterior wall of cyst
- Increased risk of organ malignancies
	- Liver
	- Gall Bladder
	- Bile Duct
	- Pancreas
	- Duodenum
### Investigation
- IOC - [MRCP](Misc#MRCP) (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiography)
- ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde)
	- Diagnostic + Therapeutic
	- Side viewing endoscope used
	- After reaching ampullae using endoscope
		- Bile duct and pancreatic ducts are cannulated
		- Dye injected to detect stone or stenosis
	- Used to
		- Remove stone from <b><u>distal</b></u> part of bile duct
		- Put stent for <b><u>distal</u></b> biliary stricture
- PTC (Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography)
	- Diagnostic + Therapeutic
	- Used to
		- Remove stone from <b><u>proximal</b></u> part of bile duct, intrahepatic bile
		- Locate stent for <b><u>proximal</b></u> biliary strictures
