## Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia
### General
- Protrusion of viscous / part of viscous through wall of it's containing cavity
### Types
#### Bochdalek Hernia
- MC type of CDH
- <u>Left sided posterolateral Hernia</u>
- Incidence - 1 in 2000 - 5000 live births
- Cause
	- Failure of fusion of <u>pleuro-peritoneal canal</u> at left side
- The left out space at the abdomen due to herniation causes the scaphoid abdomen
- MC organ herniated - Small Intestine > Stomach
- Dextrocardia
	- Since there is failure of fusion, left viscera (Spleen, Stomach and Transverse Colon) herniates and pushes heart to right
- Triad of CDH
	- Respiratory Distress
	- Dextrocardia
	- Scaphoid Abdomen
- Bag and mask ventilation <u>contraindicated</u>
	- Massive amount of air will collect in stomach causing further lung collapse
- Diagnosis
	- During pregnancy - Polyhydramnios
	- At delivery - On Chest X-ray
		- Presence of gastric bubble in thorax
		- Presence of bowel loops in thorax
		- Coiling of Ryle's tube in thorax
- Management
	- Principle of Treatment
		- Reduce herniated organs back into abdominal cavity
	- For large defects - Use prosthetic patch for closure (Mesh not used because children will grow)
	- If sac present - Excision done

#### Morgagni Hernia
- In between right side of xiphoid and central tendon of Diaphragm
	- Shape is called <u>Space of Larry</u>
	- Also called Larry's Hernia
	- Right sided retrosternal hernia
	- Normally suprior epigastric vessels pass through the space of Larry
- MC in right side
- MC organ herniated - Transverse colon
- Incidental finding
- Management
	- reduce herniated organs and close defect

#### Hiatus Hernia
##### General
- Acquired Hernia
- Common in adults
##### Types

- Factors that decrease LES pressure
	- Drugs
		- Prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>
		- Progesterone
		- Theophylline
		- Barbiturates
		- Diazepam
		- Dopamine
		- CCBs
		- Atropine
		- Nitrates
	- Foods
		- Chocolate
		- Coffee
		- Alcohol
		- Peppermint
		- Smoking
		- Fatty Food
- Incompetent LES
	- Total length < 2cm
	- Intra-abdominal length of LES < 1 cm
	- LES pressure < 6mmHg
	- Leads to GERD
### Upper Esophageal Sphincter
![UpperEsophagealSphincter](Surgery/Images/UpperEsophagealSphincter.jpg)
- It is composed of oblique fibres of <u>thyropharyngeus</u> and transverse fibres of <u>cricopharyngeus</u> muscles
- Dehiscence between the fibres of **thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus** muscles - <u>Kilian's dehiscence</u>
- Dehiscence below **cricopharyngeus** - <u>Laimer's dehiscence</u>
- Area **below and laterally to cricopharyngeus** - <u>Killian-Jamieson's area</u>
- Esophageal diverticula
	- Herniation in Killian's dehiscence  $\rightarrow$ Zenker's diverticulum
	- Herniation in Killian-Jamieson's area  $\rightarrow$ Killian-Jamieson's diverticulum
- Other esophageal diverticula
	- Mid-esophageal / Traction diverticulum **(Only true diverticulum of esophagus)**
	- Epiphrenic diverticulum (located above diaphragm)
	
#### Zenker's Diverticulum
##### General
- MC type of esophageal diverticulum
- It is a false diverticulum (mucosa and submucosa)
- MC in elderly/diabetic/males
- Inferior constrictor muscle has dual nerve supply
	- Supplies
		- Thyropharyngeus - supplied by pharyngeal plexus
		- Cricopharyngeus - supplied by RLN
	- Due to dual nerve supply - Neuromuscular incordination during swallowing leads to herniation through Killian's dehiscence due to increased pressure.
	![KilliansDehiscenece](Surgery/Images/KilliansDehiscenece.jpg)
##### Symptoms
- MC - Dysphagia
- 50% cases - Zenker's diverticula is associated with cervical web
- Halitosis
- Regurgitation
##### Complications
- MC complication - Lung abscess
- Increased risk of SCC (due to chronic inflammation of Zenker's diverticula)
##### Investigation
- IOC - Barium Swallow
	![ZenkerBariumSwallow](Surgery/Images/ZenkerBariumSwallow.jpg)
##### Treatment
- TOC - Cripharyngeal myotomy + Diverticulopexy
- Other alternative procedures
	- Diverticulectomy (for larger diverticula > 4cm)
	- Dohlman's procedure
		- Diverticulo-esophagostomy
		- It is endoscopic stapling of septum located between esophagus and diverticula

### Clinical Features
- Classical Triad of
	- Retrosternal heartburn
	- Epigastric Pain
	- Regurgitation
- MC presentation - H/o long standing heartburn with shorter h/o regurgitation

### Diagnosis
- IOC - 24 hours ambulatory pH monitoring and <u>Demeester's</u> score is calculated
	- Normal < 14.7
	- GERD > 14.7
### Management
- Lifestyle modifications
	- Cessation of smoking
	- Decrease caffeine intake
	- Avoid large meals just before lying down
- For symptomatic improvement
	- Double dose PPI
- TOC: Surgery
- Before surgery following investigations are mandatory
	- 24 hrs ambulatory pH monitoring
	- Barium swallow (rule out sliding hernia)
	- Endoscopy with biopsy (rule out Barret's Esophagus)
- Gold standard treatment of GERD - Laproscopic Nissen fundoplication 360<sup>o</sup>
### Fundoplication
- Watson fundoplication
	- Fundus of stomach taken to cover only 90<sup>o</sup> of esophagus anteriorly
	- Rarely performed
	![WatsonFundoplication](Surgery/Images/WatsonFundoplication.jpg)
- DOR fundoplication
	- Fundus of stomach is taken to cover 180<sup>o</sup> of esophagus anteriorly
	- MC performed partial fundoplication
	![DorFundoplication](Surgery/Images/DorFundoplication.jpg)
- Toupet fundoplication
	- Fundus of stomach is taken to 270<sup>o</sup> of esophagus posteriorly
	- MC performed partial fundoplication
	![ToupetFundoplication](Surgery/Images/ToupetFundoplication.jpg)
- Belsey Mark IV
	- Fundus of stomach is taken to cover 270<sup>o</sup> of esophagus anteriorly
	- Rarely performed
- Nissen's 360<sup>o</sup> fundolication
	- MC performed
	- One part of fundus is taken behind the esophagus and other part of fundus is taken in front of esophagus
	- Both of them are plicated in front of esophagus
