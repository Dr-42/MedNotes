## Triage
### General
- Used in mass casualities
- Involves prioritizing victims into categories based on

		- Immediate care is required
	- Yellow - DELAYED
		- Less critically injured patients
		- Patients require hospital treatment
	- Green - AMBULATORY
		- No life or limb threatening injury
	- Black - EXPECTANT

## ATLS Protocol
### Components
- Primary Survey
	- Aimed at detecting and simultaneously treating immediately life-threatening injuries
	- Sequence
		- A - Airway maintainance with cervical spine protection
		- B - Breathing that includes ventilation and oxygenation
		- C - Circulation with hemorrhage control
		- D - Disability (breif neurological examination)
		- E - Exposure with environmental control
- Secondary Survey
	- Consists of head to toe systematic assessment with special emphasis to
		- Abdominal
		- Pelvic
		- Thoracic
	- Complete inspection of body surface to find all injuries and neurological examination
- Tertiary survey (NOT IN ATLS)
	- It is a comprehensive patient evaluation after initial resustitation (after 24 hrs)
	- It includes
		- Through physical examination
		- Combined with targeted radiographic imaging
			- Xray
			- USG or CT based on exam
### Primary Survey
#### Airway Maintainance with cervical spine protection
- <u>Cervical spine > Airway</u>
- In all trauma patients
	- Cervical spine injury is to be suspected
	- Cervical spine immobilization should be done
- Assess the patency of airway - By eliciting verbal Response
- Ability to speak - suggestive of Adequete airway protection
- If patient is not able to speak, SUSPECT:
	- Mental status depression
	- Obstruction of airway
- Both of the above require airway management
- Other indications for airway management
	- Noisy breathing
	- Facial Trauma
	- GCS ≤ 8
- Stepwise progression in compromised airway
	1. Clear the airway - By suctioning secretions and blood
	2. Chin lift/Jaw thrust
	3. Insertion of oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway
		- Definitive airway of choice in most trauma patients - <u>Oral endotracheal intubation with cuffed ET tube</u>
- In patients of sever maxillofacial injuries
	- Needle cricothoracotomy
		- Emergency airway of choice
		- Performed quickly
		- High flow O<sub>2</sub> given via 4-6 mm tube
		- Disadvantages
			- CO<sub>2</sub> retention within 20-30 mins
			- Avoided in children < 12 years due to risk of subglottic stenosis
	- Tracheostomy - Definitive airway of choice
#### Breathing (Ventilation + Oxygenation)
##### General
- Assess breathing - by visualizing chest movements
- Assess rate and depth - by percussion and auscultation
- O<sub>2</sub> saturation
- Limited respiratory efforts/dyspnea $\rightarrow$ patient requires ventilation and further assessment
##### Causes of Ventilation problem
- Tension Pneumothorax
	- Clinical diagnosis based on suspicion
	- Wide bore needle in 2<sup>nd</sup> IC space at MCL
		- According to ATLS 10<sup>th</sup> edition - needle in 5<sup>th</sup> IC space slightly anterior to MAL in adults
- Massive hemothorax
	- ICD insertion (28-32F)
		- According to 11<sup>th</sup> edition of Schwartz - Anterior axillary line for ICD
- Massive pulmonary contusion
	- For severe pulmonary contusion - Aggressive mechanical ventilation
#### Circulation with Hemorrhage Control
##### General
- Assess Circulation - Primary goal is to look for shock
	- MC cause of shock in trauma - Bleeding (Hypovolemic shock)
- Assess vitals
	- Unstable
		- PR > 100/min
		- BP < 100mmHg
- Mx of shock
	- Put two large bore IV canula (Green 18G)
	- Send blood for cross match
	- 1-2 litres of warn isotonic crytalloid solution (Old edition)
		- ATLS 10<sup>th</sup> edition 
			- 1 L of warm crystalloid solution in adults
			- 20 mL/kg warm crystalloid in children < 40 kg
- Rapid screening - Identify cases of life-threatening blood loss
##### Major Causes
1. External blood loss (on the floor at the site of accident)
2. Chest
3. Abdomen
4. Retroperitoneum (Pelvic fracture)
5. Multiple long bone fracture
##### Steps
- During initial physical examination
	- Identify the source of external bleeding - Direct pressure over the site of bleeding
	- Identify long bone fracture - Splinting to be done
- Investigations done
	- CXR - to evaluate thoracic blood loss
	- X-ray Pelvis - to identify pelvic fracture
	- FAST - to evaluate abdomen
	- CECT not done in primary survey
- Two most Xrays for trauma patients
	- CXA (PA)
	- Xray pelvis (AP)
- In non-responding pateints with ongoing signs of shock
	- Manage ongoing bleeding
	- Blood transfusion
- In trauma transfusion ratio followed
	- Packed cell : Plasma : Platelets
	-         1            :       1       :        1
- Best indicator of tissue perfusion in trauma - <u>Urine output</u>
- Best indicator to determine fluid requirement - <u>CVP</u>
##### CRASH-2 Trial
- Recommends use of Tranexamic acid in hypotensive trauma pateints
	- 1 g IV over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over 8 hours
- Advantages
	- Reduces the risk of mortality from bleeding in both blunt and penetrating trauma
- Indications
	- All trauma patients suspected to have significant hemorrhage including **SBP < 110 mmHg or PR > 110/min**
	- Administration within 3 hours of injury
#### Disability
##### General
- Assess GCS
- Assess pupils
	- Size
	- Equality
	- Reaction

- Maximum GCS Score - 15 (E4 V5 M6)
- Minimum GCS Score - 3 (E1 V1 M1)
- Best indicator of prognosis - Motor response
- On the basis of GCS score
	- 13-15 $\rightarrow$ Mild head injury
	- 9 - 12 $\rightarrow$ Moderate head injury
	- ≤ 8 $\rightarrow$ Severe head injury
#### Exposure/Environment control
