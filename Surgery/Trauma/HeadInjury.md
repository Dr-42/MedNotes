## Brain Injury
### Types
#### Primary
- Neural damage attributed to traumatic insult itself
- Includes
	- Shearing of axonal neorons
	- Contusion or Laceration of cerebral tissues
	- Diffuse axonal injuries
#### Secondary
- Occurs after some time
- Preventable causes
	- Hypoxia
	- Hypotension
	- $\uparrow$ ICT
	- $\downarrow$ CPP
	- Pyrexia
### Concussion
- Temporary neuronal dysfunction following non-penetrating trauma
- NCCT - normal
- Deficits resolve over minutes to hours
### Contusion
- Cerebral contusion results from being damaged by
	- Impacting against skull at the point of impact <u>(coup)</u>
	- On the opposite side of impact <u>(counter coup)</u>
- Most commonly affects **Inferior frontal lobe & temporal lobe**
- IOC - NCCT head
- Treatment
	- Conservative management (generally)
	- Surgery (rarely required)
		- Delayed surgical intervention to reduce the mass effect

## Meninges
### General
- 3 layers
	- Dura mater
	- Arachnoid mater
	- Pia mater
	![Meninges](Surgery/Images/Meninges.jpg)

### Extradural and Subdural Hematoma
#### Extradural Hematoma
##### General
- Blood collects between skull and dura (peeled off)
- Doesn't cross suture line
- MC site - Temporal bone
	- Pterion - thinnest part of skull
	- Trivial trauma
- Caused by injury to middle meningeal artery
- Lucid interval positive
##### Investigation
- IOC - NCCT head
- In NCCT - Shows biconvex or lenticula hyperdense lesion
	![EDHNCCT](Surgery/Images/EDHNCCT.jpg)
##### Treatment

	- Burrhole
	- Craniotomy
#### Subdural Hemorrhage

- On the side of hematoma close to pterion

#### Investigation
- IOC for diagnosis - NCCT head
#### Management
- Conservative

## Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI)
### General
- Wide spread axonal damage involving both hemispheres after severe head injury
- Results from application of shearing force leading to axonal injury
	- Acceleration
	- Deceleration
	- Angular strain to the brain
- MC site - Lobar white matter > Corpus callosum > Brain stem
### Clinical Features
- Loss of conscioussness
- MC cause of <u>post traumatic vegetative state</u>
- ICT can be normal or raised
### Investigation
- NCCT head - Normal
- IOC - MRI
### Prognosis
- Extremely poor

## Raised ICT
### Pathophysiology
- Brain depends on continuous perfusion for O<sub>2</sub> and glucose supply
- Normal cerebral blood flow - 55mL/min for every 100gm of brain tissue
- Cerebral blood flow depends on cerebral perfusion pressure
- Cerebral perfusion pressure - MAP - Intracranial Pressure
	- Normal CPP is 75 - 105 mmHg
	- Normal MAP is 90 - 110 mmHg
	- Normal ICP is 5 - 15 mmHg
- If ICP $\uparrow$ - CPP$\downarrow$  $\rightarrow$ leading to ischemia
- Uncontroled $\uparrow$ in ICP leads to
	- Cerebral herniation
	- Cerebellar tonsilar herniation through Foramen Magnum
		- Compresses medullary vasomotr and respiratory centers
		- Causes <u>Cushing's Triad</u>
			- Hypertension
			- Bradycardia
			- Irregular respiration
### Active Management of $\uparrow$ ICT
1. Elevate head end of bed to 30<sup>o</sup> (reverse T/B position)
2. Drain CSF - Ventriculostomy
3. Osmotherapy - Mannitol
4. Glucocorticoids - Dexamethason
	- Avoid in
		- Head Injury
		- Ischemic Stroke
		- Hemorrhagic stroke
5. Sedation
	- Morphine
	- Propofol
	- Midazolam
	- N/M paralysis
6. Hyperventilation - ET intubate (only for short period of time)
7. ICP monitoring
#### Goals
- ICP < 22 mmHg
- CPP â‰¥ 60mmHg
- In case ICP > 20-25 mmHg for 5 min Active Management
- Second tier therapies - For refractory elevated ICP
	- Decompressive craniotomy
	- High dose barbiturate therapy
	- Hypothermia (37<sup>o</sup>  $\rightarrow$ 33<sup>o</sup> )
