# Thoracic Injuries

## Neck Injuries
### General
- Major vascular and aerodigestive structures located in <u>Anterior triangle(Deep to Platysma)</u>
- Platysma
	- If injuries didn't penetrate platysma - Superficial injury
		- No forther investigations req.
	- If injuries penetrated platysma - Needs evaluation
- Sternocleidomastoid
	- Injury anterior to SCM - High likelihood of significant injury
	- Injury posterior to SCM - Low chances of injury to major vascular and aerodigestive structures
	- Penetrating injuries to posterior triangle - Possibel injury to
		- Cervical spine
		- Cord
### Zones of Neck Injuries
![NeckInjuryZones](Surgery/Images/NeckInjuryZones.jpg)
#### Zone I
- Between sternal notch to cricoid cartilage
- Structures located
	- Carotid vessels
	- Aerodigestive structures (Trachea and Esophagus)
- Highest mortality rate - Due to **Carotid vessel injury**
#### Zone II
- Between cricoid cartilage to angle of mandible
- Most exposed and MC injured zone
- Most surgically accessible zone
#### Zone III
- Between angle of mandible to base of skull

## Thoracic Injuries
### General
- MC thoracic injuries - Chest wall injuries
- MC causes of mortality
	- In blunt thoracic trauma - Tracheobronchial injuries
	- In penetrating trauma - Hemothorax secondary to pulmonary laceration
### Rib Fractures
- Occurs secondary to compression in
	- AP direction
	- Lateral direction
- MC fractured rib in **CPR** - 4<sup>th</sup> - 6<sup>th</sup> rib
- Fracture of 1<sup>st</sup> rib and 10<sup>th</sup> - 12<sup>th</sup> rib are uncommon
- Only high velocity impact can cause 1<sup>st</sup> & 10<sup>th</sup> - 12<sup>th</sup> rib fracture.
- Floating ribs are 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> ribs
- In 1<sup>st</sup> rib fracture suspect injury to
	- Subclavian vessels
	- Brachial plexus
	- Apex of the lung
- In 10<sup>th</sup> 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> rib fracture, suspect injury to
	- Liver (Right side)
	- Spleen (Left side)
		- Spleen is in relation with 9<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup> ribs
		- Long axis of spleen is in relation with 10<sup>th</sup> rib
- Management
	- Coservative management with adequete anaesthesia
	- Strapping should not be done

### Sternal Fractures
- Uncommon and typically transverse
- Located in upper and midportions of body of sternum
- Signs of Sternal fracture
	- Tenderness
	- Swelling
	- Deformity
- It is associated with - Severe thoracic injury
- Has specific injury to **myocardium**
- Management
	- Conservative management with 
		- Adequete analgesia
		- Good pulmonary hygiene
	- Surgical intervention - For displaced sternal fracture

### Hemothorax
#### General
- Collection of blood in pleural space
- MC cause of Hemothorax - Trauma
- MC cause of massive hemothorax - Torn intercostal vessels (2<sup>o</sup> to rib fracture)
#### Clinical Features
- Dyspnea
- Tachypnea
- Dull note on percussion
- Absent breath sounds
#### Diagnosis
- Needle aspiration of pleural fluid - Shows blood
- CXR
	- ![HemothoraxCXR](Surgery/Images/HemothoraxCXR.jpg)
#### Management
- ICD insertion in triangle of safety in 5<sup>th</sup> IC space in Anterior axillary line
- Boundaries of triangle of safety
	- Anteriorly - Lateral border of Pec. major
	- Laterally - Lateral border of Latissimus dorsi
	- Inferiorly - Line of 5<sup>th</sup> IC space
	- Superiorly - Base of axilla

#### Indications of Thoracotomy
- Initial tube thoracostomy drainage
	- >1000mL in Penetrating trauma
	- > 1500mL in Blunt trauma
- Ongoing tube thoracstomy drainage
	- > 200mL/hr for consecutive 3hrs in non-coagulopathic patinets
- Caked Hemothorax despite two chest tube placements
- Tracheobronchial injuries
- Descending torn aorta or great vessels
- Pericardial tamponade
- Cardiac herniation
- Massive air leak from chest tube with inadequete ventilation
- Open pneumothorax
- Esophageal perforation

### Tension Pneumothorax
#### General
- Occurs when **one way valve** is created - air leaks either from lungs or chest wall
- Air is forced into thoracic cavity without any means of escape
- Causes complete lung collapse
#### Pathology
- Collapse of ipsilateral lung
- Shift of mediastinum (d/t high pressure)
- Depressed diaphragm
- Decreased venous return (d/t compression of SVC and IVC)
- Mediastinum
	- Displaced to opposite side
	- $\downarrow$ venous return and compression of opposite lung
#### Etiology
- Penetrating trauma to chest
- Blunt trauma - Tracheobronchial injury
- Iatrogenic lung puncture - Due to subclavian central venepuncture during central line insertion
- Mechanical positive pressure ventilation
#### Clinical Features
- Dyspnea
- Tachypnea
- Distended neck veins
- Hyper resonance (on percussion)
- Absent breath sounds (on auscultation)
#### Investigation
- Diagnosed clinically
#### Treatment
- Emergeny treatment - Put large bore needle in 2<sup>nd</sup> space at Midclavicular line 
	- ATLS 10<sup>th</sup> edition 5<sup>th</sup> IC space slightly anterior to mid-axillary line
- TOC - ICD insertion in triangle of safety

### Pericardial Tamponade
#### General
- Rapid accumulation of blood or fluid in pericardial space
- Quantity of even 200mL if collected rapidly leads to tamponade
- Caused by penetrating trauma
#### Clinical Features
- Beck's Triad
	- **M**uffled heart sound
	- **D**istended neck veins
	- **H**ypotension
#### Investigations
- IOC - Echocardiography
- CXR - Shows enlarged heart shadow
	![CardiacTamponadeCXR](Surgery/Images/CardiacTamponadeCXR.jpg)	
#### Treatment
- Emergency - Needle pericardiocentesis
- TOC - Pericardiotomy

### Flail Chest
#### General
- Occurs when segment of chest wall doesn't have any bony continuity with rest of thoracic cage
- Caused by - **Fracture of ≥ 2 consecutive ribs at ≥ 2 places**
- Associated with pulmonary contusion
#### Clinical Features
- Paradoxical Respiration (Fractured part moves opposite than rest of chest)
- Voluntary splinting d/t pain  $\rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ risk of respiratory failure
- Mechanically impaired chest wall movement
#### Investigation
- Diagnosed clinically
	- Observe chest wall segment for paradoxical motion
	- Ask patient to cough
		- Chest cavity moves in
		- Flail segment moves out
#### Treatment
- O<sub>2</sub> administration + adequete analgesia (Epidural) + Physiotherapy
- For flail chest + Respiratory failure - **Intermittent Positive pressure ventilation (IPPV)**

### Diaphragmatic Injury
#### General 
- MC cause - Penetrating injury
- For penetrating injury at
	- Below nipple
	- Above costal margin
#### Etiology
- Penetrating trauma
- Blunt trauma - Compressive force applied to pelvi or abdomen can lead to diaphragmatic injury
#### Clinical Features
- Most injuries are silent
- Patient presents with Signs and symptoms of associated organs
- Late complication - Herniation
- MC organ herniated - Stomach > Colon > Small intestine
#### Investigations
- No single standard investigation
- Most accurate evaluation can be done by
	- VATS - video assisted thoracoscopy
	- Laproscopy
- Surgeon can also proceed to repair and evaluate other abdominal organs
#### Treatment
- Operative repair in all cases

## Blast Injuries
- Primary blast injuries result from
	- Rapid overpressure
	- Showck waves by blast
- Dramatic changes in barometric pressure 
	- Cause damage to air filled organs
		- Lungs
		- GIT
- Types
	- Air Blast
		- MC injured - Typnaic membrane > Lungs
		- Most severly injured - Lungs
	- Water blast
		- When head is out of water
			- Most commonly and severly injured - GIT
		- When head is submerged
			- MC injured - Tympanic membrane
			- Most severly injured - GIT
## ICD Insertion
	![ICD](Surgery/Images/ICD.jpg)
- ICD insertion should be done in Triangle of Safety
- Should be done near upper border of lower rib
- Eyes of Chest Tube should be in pleural space
- Used to provide evacuation for air and fluid
- Under water seal chamber
	- Acts as one way valve for evacuation
	- Tip should be 2-3cm below water seal
	- Fluid contents are forced out through chest tube into underwater seal
- Patency of chest tube is assessed by observing **oscillations in water column**
- If column movement stops - Tube is blocked/displaced
- Bronchopleural fistula - Excessive bubbling of air
- Position of chest tube and resolution of intrapleural air is checked by **Chest Xray**
- Removal of chest tube is considered
	- When lung is fully expanded _or_
	- [Drain output < 200mL in 24hrs](Misc#Ideal%20time%20of%20drain%20removal)
- Removal - Done at breath holding in peak inspiration
